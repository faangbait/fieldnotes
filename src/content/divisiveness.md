If there are too many wolves, some wolves starve. If there are too many rabbits, fewer wolves starve. If fewer wolves starve, there will be too many wolves, and some wolves will starve. Repeat indefinitely.

Political parties tend towards an evenly-split distribution nationwide. Social media creates this distribution organically, much like wolves and rabbits keep each others' populations in check. After all, you need two people to have an argument, and they both have to be on opposite sides.

Like wolves and rabbits, if too many people on social media support the same political party, voter turnout for that party will be lower. If turnout is lower, the other side wins. When the other side wins, your side spends more time arguing on social media. In the next election, voter turnout for your party will be higher. And too many people on social media will support the same party again. Repeat indefinitely.

Why does this matter? Because social media profits are driven by algorithms designed to increase engagement, and the best way to increase engagement is to get people to argue. And you need two people to have an argument, and they both have to be on opposite sides.
