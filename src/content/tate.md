Jimmy Carr, in his recent interview on 'Diary of a CEO,' described Andrew Tate as "a 14-year-old boy's idea of what masculinity looks like." That's only half-true -- it's indeed a 14-year old boy's idea of what masculinity looks like, but it's also a 38-year old man's idea of what masculinity looks like.

If Andrew Tate is to be considered a bad influence, it should only be insofar as he's a bad influence to children. I disagree with the premise that he's a bad influence to adults.

A 14-year-old boy only sees the surface -- the women, cars, money, arrogance, and offensive positions he takes -- and **emulation of these traits is a recipe for immature, selfish, and tyrannical masculinity**. Toxic, if you will. That's an unhealthy thing for a 14-year-old boy to see.

But I am not a 14-year-old boy. I see the whole package -- a hustler that earns enough money across several businesses to feed himself; a man with the wisdom to set boundaries and demand respect; a warrior who seeks virtus - the Roman concept that values strength, courage, honor, moderation, and self-control as its highest ideals; and, of course, **a habitual, offensive troll**.

I'm certainly not the first person to suggest that he's trolling. His motivation is painfully obvious. Offensive tweets are his idea of fun. He knows exactly what kind of response they will get. He doesn't care. **He says it because he thinks you're cute when you're angry.**

The lesson you should consider taking from Andrew Tate is, "if other people can say things that compel me to respond, they are in control of me. I can regain self-control by simply ignoring them. I could even retweet him, if I choose to; **it's my life, and no one -- not peer pressure, not laws, not societal norms -- will tell me how to live it."**

For what it's worth, I'd never say what he says. I tend to agree with the anti-poet:

> There's one rule, goddamnit: you've got to be kind.
>
> ***Kurt Vonnegut***

Still, I see the value in having a few incendiary figures who, by their existence, demonstrate that **being kind is a choice we make, not a requirement forced upon us.** I choose to be a warrior in a garden, but let's be crystal clear: if you are evil enough to not deserve kindness, I can also choose to be relentless in giving you exactly what you have coming. **I'm not cute when I'm angry.**

**The indisputable essence of masculinity is having the self-control to choose when to be kind and when to be unkind.** Not as an emotional response, but when it's inarguable that all the lines have been crossed, and an unkind response is warranted. Tate believes all the lines have been crossed vis a vis the emasculation of men in society, and he's chosen to "break people out of the matrix" as a response.

It's not how I'd do it, but it's not my life, and I don't think he rises to the level of evil that he deserves my attention for his "offensive tweets." But yet, he does have my attention for a different reason.

What I've learned in the 24 years of life since I was a 14-year-old boy is that wisdom is everywhere around you. I can listen to Andrew Tate if I choose to. I'm capable of reading between the lines and finding kernels of wisdom. He may not even know when he's said something profound; more than likely, it was enlightening by pure chance, and I am alone in paying it any heed. **True wisdom comes from within and cannot be transferred, only triggered.** I am always searching for those triggers, and what works for me is listening to people I disagree with.

Above all, I can assure you, dear Reader, **there is no risk of Andrew Tate being a bad influence on me, because I don't need a father figure. I am the father figure.**
