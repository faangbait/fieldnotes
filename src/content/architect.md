Dear You,

I'll take you at your word that you enjoyed our conversation. Shall we continue it?

If any of your roles say, "Just show up and do whatever, because you're special," I'll take that one instead. Alas, nobody's ever offered me that before. My scope has always been boilerplate data entry, one byte at a time into a syntax checker, doing my part to keep the lights on. I know that's a generic description, but it has to be generic to cover everything, no?

Despite years of working as a Senior __________ Engineer and not caring much how you fill in that blank, I've never had a job in tech I didn't like, and my coworkers have always been outstanding. When you can tick both of those boxes, the work never gets tedious, so you never burn out. If you're insinuating that I need to raise Cain to stay motivated, I politely reject your assessment.

A few years ago I, too, saw the patterns that led to your conclusions. I've made conscious choices to keep my good patterns and stop my anti-patterns, but you couldn't have known that, or my judging criteria. It wouldn't be fair to say "you're wrong, you don't know me" without breaking down some of those choices in detail. If you are sincere in considering me for other roles, you'll have to get to know me eventually, so why not now? Here goes.

One of the patterns I chose to keep was seeking out absurdly diverse roles, technologies, tasks, and industries. Being a greenhorn in something is really hard, but I know of no better way to grow. The bonus I didn't expect: I got a lot of practice at getting up to speed. I start contributing in days, not months.

Still, simply growing is not enough - you need to grow towards something. I picked quality. It sounds narcissistic, but I didn't choose it for the connotations of superiority, or the higher pay, or truthfully, even for the pride of a job well done. The first reason is because quality is one of the few things in this world that isn't up for debate and doesn't change as years pass. It's remarkable to me that five people from anywhere in the world can look at a chair and all pretty much agree on its level of quality. The second reason -- and I'm defining quality as robust, maintainable systems -- is because I know that my legacy when I'm gone will be my code, and if it's all replaced in ten years, that's not much of a legacy.

In other words, I'm not trying to be an architect. I'm trying to craft things that last. Doing that consistently and at velocity requires an architect to clear roadblocks, but I'm very happy for that to be someone else, because I'd rather be building... and there's plenty of time for management-level positions after the arthritis starts.

I take your point that my work history suggests that I have a talent for that sort of role. My default perspective is top-down, and doing traditional bottom-up stuff like TDD didn't come to me naturally. But I practiced it until I loved it. I suspect I come across as more top-down in first impressions, but the reality is the opposite.

The reason I _can_ step outside my scope and analyze an intractable problem from the top down is simply because I've practiced it. My intuition for design surprises me more than you would imagine, because tech has never "clicked" for me. I feel like the concept implies complete understanding, and every year that seems to get further away. In fact, the only thing I know for certain ends in a question itself. "We can build it however you want it, but can you afford it?"

So why bother going broad, when I could just learn Java and have a great career?

The reason I _do_ step outside my scope is because I suspect there are no impossible problems in computing. Circuits are binary and arithmetic. Everything else, we made, and we can make it differently. If one solution is too expensive, and another won't work on mobile, and a third has "bad tokenomics," but my gut tells me there's still a thread that shows promise, I dig a little deeper or a little wider. I get more T-shaped in the process, which makes me a better engineer, which makes my next solution better. As a result, I'm more likely to end up outside my job description, because I tugged at threads until I became a SME in this, too. That's the simple answer -- I don't innovate because I want to change things up every week, but because the process of innovating leads directly to increasing quality across the board. People should do everything; specialization is for insects. 

It would follow that you're passing on me because I chose the pattern of trying to being involved outside of my silo. Sure, always accepting curiosity, challenges, and new environments does create a high likelihood that I'll fail and be terribly embarrassed. On the other hand, you can't aimlessly wander into an R&D budget, so its not like I've unilaterally decided to change my own job description, either. I have to be pulled into these roles by the Jira Commanders. I won't bother to deny that I've often ended up on whatever project the CEO has the biggest personal financial stake in at the moment.

But that's plenty of rambling on my philosophy. Let's talk about yours, because you wouldn't be the first person I've heard the following criticisms from.

I'll grant you the benefit of the doubt that you didn't assume I'm a cowboy because I'm self-taught. That assumption wouldn't be wrong often, and I did spend a bunch of years as a cowboy, but I stepped across that line a long way back on the journey towards quality. I push idempotent commits to my personal repo with a title and description just like every other senior developer, but I do it knowing that the only contributor who will ever read it is my future self. Because that guy's a stickler, and he reads git blames.

But if the top-down perception didn't come from the cowboy, it's gotta be the resume. I'll be the first to admit my resume's covered in projects I spearheaded. I'm not blind to the fact that it gives the appearance that "solo architect" and "lone wolf rockstar" are the only hats I can wear, but that's certainly not the full portrait. It's just the one that gets painted by an unfortunate anti-pattern: PDFs are still trying to be an analogue for paper.

The reality is that it's a constant fight with my pagebreaks to fit just my favorite highlights on two pages, because I've been doing this a while and I love all my projects. If I allocated a bullet point for every time I worked inside the scope of my job description for a year, my resume would be six pages long and nobody would read it. 

But if they did read it, the story would be that my team moved faster with me behind them, not in front of them, so I stayed behind them until they ran out of gas. But then, instead of forcing them to match my pace, or carrying them, or running off and leaving them behind, I just got curious... how much work would it be to flip the racetrack?

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Please do keep me in mind for whatever you've got -- I'll even dig your ditches at the salary I'm asking. But since I'm fully unemployed right now, I don't have the luxury of time.

Because I've been in developer growth mode for long enough... it's time to consolidate, execute, bank, and get fat and wise.

If you can come through for me and make this position or a similar one happen sooner rather than later, I expect it to be the last job I have until it's time for me to join the rest of the blind sages sitting on their mountaintops, talking in koans and metaphors. 

Apologies for going verbosity=4 on you,

Sam
