I was watching the Pete Holmes [comedy special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJguU6sLR-8), and he made a poignant argument about atheism that deserves expanding. He said that God might not exist, but nothing definitely does not exist. For the universe to be created by God is unlikely, but for it to be created by nothing is impossible. The punchline was, "and if this all came from nothing, it was a pretty goddamn magical nothing!"

First, a rhetorical clarification: **atheists don't really believe we "came from nothing."** They believe we came from _nothing sentient_. Nobody's denying the existence of fundamental physics; it's just that our language doesn't have the words -- our brain doesn't have the concepts -- to **explain what it means to exist in a place before time.**

## The Logical Impossibility

In that timeless void -- whether it's the instant before the Big Bang or the instant before "God created the heaven and the earth" -- the idea of where things "came from" loses meaning. To speak of "coming from" something requires causality -- cause and effect; before and after. So while we can speak of "the instant before," we are speaking of a thing without meaning. There was no "before."

The Bible trips itself from the outset, in Genesis 1:1, when it says "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." Such an event is impossible. To create a thing implies causality already existing. How did God cause the heavens and earth to be created without causality?

It would stand to reason that to go from a moment where causality didn't exist to a moment where it does exist is not only fundamentally impossible, it's fundamentally illogical. **To do the fundamentally impossible requires only the supernatural, but to do the fundamentally illogical requires something far beyond that.**

## Doing the Superlogical 

I'll refer to an agent that can do something fundamentally illogical as **superlogical,** for lack of a better term.

What does it mean to be superlogical? It requires that, whether it was God, or nothing, or physics, or magic, sentient or not, **in creating "the beginning," the actor needed to violate logic itself**. Such creation would require the ability to establish fundamental truths on the order of **"if p then q; p; therefore q,"** without the pre-existence of "if" or "then."

The human mind would cleave itself in half trying to conceive of the universe that would flow from an agent like that existing. The most learned philosophers should be able to reason, a priori, that such a universe does not exist. **But here it is.** 

It'll take a smarter man than me to crack that one. **Call it God for all I care, because it was, in fact, a pretty goddamn magical nothing.**
