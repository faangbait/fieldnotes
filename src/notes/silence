The most obvious silence is that of thousands of dependencies fulfilling their programmers' wishes without further instruction. Like the silence of a raft on the ocean, surrounded by an endless expanse of unfathomable depths, its undercurrents are transparent, and anyone brave enough to open their eyes beneath the surface may learn of a deeper nature. The silence of our libraries speaks volume. Even though we have ample means to disrupt other developers -- who apply to the same jobs, compete for the same promotions, and bill the same clients -- we choose to make things that help them.

At my repository, anyone may congregate to share expertise and build new toys. Because a line of code knows no bounds and no censors, traditional labels like age, race, gender, or political affiliation mean very little to any of us. The more useful labels are those we assign to ourselves: RedHat or Debian? The rigor of strong-typing or the lassez-faire of an untyped language? It's by these new tribes we are reminded that a home and a hearth are waiting for each of us, and our future friends are already there, awaiting our arrival. This is the silence of an open seat near a crackling fire, the silence of warmth.

My repository exists to share code with no questions asked and no demands made. Most new users clone my repository to copy its code and may conclude that, if we all play nice, being able to paste great code into our application is our reward. Such misunderstandings deserve correction. Helpfulness and warmth do not \textit{precede} but \textit{follow from} my repository, for the act of releasing code without restrictive licenses holds space for the third silence -- one so critical that the others would fall like dominoes without it, so fragile that it cannot itself resist any pressure, and so silent it is oft noticed only moments after it's gone. If one listens closely enough, they may yet keep it and save three silences in turn: it sounds like the beating heart of freedom.
